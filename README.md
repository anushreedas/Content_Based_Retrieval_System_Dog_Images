# Content_Based_Retrieval_System_Dog_Images

A study of content based image retrieval system or an image based search engine which looks for similar images with respect to the query image and returns them.
Different feature extraction techniques are compared resulting from different approaches like
1. color based histogram,
2. texture from gabor filter,
3. history of oriented gradients(HOG),
4. neural network like Resnet50.

Choose system from line 57 to 60 in CBIR.py
Run CBIR.py
